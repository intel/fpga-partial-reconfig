# Intel&reg; FPGA Partial Reconfiguration Design Flow

This repository contains scripts, reference designs, and tutorials for the Intel FPGA Partial Reconfiguration design flow.

- [Tutorials](tutorials/) are located in the tutorials sub directory
- [Reference Designs](ref_designs/) are located in the ref_designs sub directory
- [Software](software/) and Linux drivers are located in the software sub directory 
- [Scripts](scripts/) are located in the scripts sub directory
- [Verification](verification/) components for simulation are located in the verification sub directory

The Partial Reconfiguration Design Flow is supported in the Intel Quartus Prime&reg; Pro Edition software for Intel Arria 10 Devices with the following key features:

   - Command line and graphical user interface for compilation and analysis
   - Hierarchical Partial Reconfiguration that allows you to create child PR partitions in your design
   - Simulation of Partial Reconfiguration that allows you to observe the resulting change and the intermediate effect in a reconfiguration partition
   - Signal Tap debug with simultaneous acquisition of both the Static region and Partial Reconfiguration regions
   - Refer to the [Intel® Quartus® Prime Pro Edition User Guide: Partial Reconfiguration](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683834/23-2/faq.html) for information about Partial Reconfiguration


[Releases](https://github.com/01org/fpga-partial-reconfig/releases) are created for each major version of Quartus Prime Software. It is recommended to use the release for your version of Quartus Prime.
